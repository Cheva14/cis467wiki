            student at GVSU graduating in December. He has had 4 internships in
            the automotive industry with the most reacent internship being at
            Ford Motor Company. Once graduated he plans on continuing pursuing a
            software enginnering role in the automotive industry. He has
            experience agile software development, specifically with scrum
            project managment. He is most familiar with Java, Python, and C
            coding languages and has created mobile app in the past through
            GVSU'S CIS 357 mobile app devlopment course.

            After graduation, he hopes to pursue software engineering
            opportunities within the Grand Rapids area. He is currently working
            as an intern at Digital Marketing Solutions LLC as a web/app
            developer assistant. He has lots of experience working with Java,
            Python, and C, and is proficient in Swift, and Kotlin. He has
            created and worked on apps before in both Android and iOS; for one
            of his projects, he created an AR Android app that used ARCore to be
            able to load and place models in the world. Mobile applications are
            something that Kevin has always wanted to dig deeper into, and this
            project will provide him with great experience.

            a job as a software engineer/software development/full-stack
            developer/web developer. He has had one internship where he worked
            in web development. He learned about the back end by talking to the
            front end. He is proficient in multiple programming languages like
            JavaScript, Python, Java, C, HTML, etc. He believes my experience
            with Javascript will be the most useful for this project. he has
            tried to make my own iOS apps in the past in Swift, but he was never
            able to finish them since they consumed a lot of my time and he did
            not like Swift. He is familiar with MySQL navigating SQL databases,
            and generating queries. he had a lot of experience with this in my
            internship making queries for the website.

            <strong>Matt Ferretti</strong>: Matthew has never used React Native
            before and have never coded in Javascript which is the language this
            project will be using. To learn this language and learn React Native
            Matthew plan on and has already started working through Javascript
            and React Native courses through the well known Code Academy
            website. He also does not have much experince with UI/UX devlopement
            but is excited to do some research to better understand how to
            impliment the best UI/IX for the user. He also does not have much
            experience with online databases like Firebase which is intended to
            be implimented within this app but plans to what youtube videos and
            read articles to better understand how it works.

            <strong>Kevin Nguyen</strong>: Kevin has not really worked much with
            CSS, which React Native uses. He intends to learn by going through
            courses such as Codecademy, and tutorials and other resources posted
            online. He also does not have much experience with UI and UX design,
            but by working with the sponsor and hopefully getting user input, he
            hopes to grow and learn more about what works and what does not. He
            plans to put his new experiences in CSS, React Native, and UI/UX
            into developing an app for his familyâ€™s new business. This project
            will also require that the team use cloud services, which Kevin does
            have a little bit of experience in using Firebase; the team expects
            to use Firebase for this application, but they may also look into
            other alternatives.

            <strong>Sebastian Torrejon Alonzo</strong>: Sebastian hasn't had
            much experience with using and implementing API's to his projects.
            He also would like to learn about new technologies. He has never
            used Firebase but he is excited to learn how it works and how to
            implement it in the project. He has limited experience with cloud
            services when storing a database but he has created a AWS website
            before. He wants to learn how can he store a database with Firebase
            in the cloud. He plans to find tutorials on YouTube to learn this
            new skill. He also wants to get more experience with UI design and
            make it as accessible for everyone as possible. His personal goal in
            this project is to make the best app possible to display in his
            resume for future job applications in mobile development. He thinks
            that working with his classmates and keeping track of the time spent
            on the project is a good way to learn to work with other people and
            appreciate the time and effort that they put in their work.
